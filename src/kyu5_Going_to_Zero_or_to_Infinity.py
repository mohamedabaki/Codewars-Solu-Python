    Consider the following numbers (where n! is factorial(n)):

    u1 = (1 / 1!) * (1!)

    u2 = (1 / 2!) * (1! + 2!)

    u3 = (1 / 3!) * (1! + 2! + 3!)

    un = (1 / n!) * (1! + 2! + 3! + ... + n!)

    Which will win: 1 / n! or (1! + 2! + 3! + ... + n!)?

    Are these number going to 0 because of 1/n! or to infinity due to the sum of factorials?

    Task:

        Calculate (1 / n!) * (1! + 2! + 3! + ... + n!) for a given n.
        Call this function "going(n)" where n is an integer greater or equal to 1.

        To avoid discussions about rounding,
        if the result of the calculation is designed by "result",
        going(n) will return "result" truncated to 6 decimal places.

    Examples:

        1.0000989217538616 will be truncated to 1.000098
        1.2125000000000001 will be truncated to 1.2125

    Remark:

        Keep in mind that factorials grow rather rapidly,
        and you can need to handle large inputs.
